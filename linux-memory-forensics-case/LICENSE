CASE MATERIALS DISCLAIMER:

CASE ID: CASE_20251228_0001
ANALYSIS DATE: 2025-12-31
EVIDENCE TYPE: Linux Memory Forensics (LiME RAM Image Analysis)

This repository contains:
- Forensic analysis findings from a controlled lab environment
- Real attack artifacts and malware indicators
- Technical deep-dives into sophisticated attack techniques
- Python reverse shell code and shellcode disassembly

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:

1. CONTAINED ENVIRONMENT ONLY
   These findings are from a deliberately compromised lab VM in an isolated
   network segment. Do not use these findings as authorization to compromise
   production systems or attempt similar attacks without explicit written
   permission.

2. EDUCATIONAL REFERENCE ONLY
   The techniques documented here are for understanding attack methods and
   improving defensive security posture. Using this information to conduct
   unauthorized attacks on any system (test or production) is illegal.

3. PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
   This material is intended for security professionals, incident responders,
   and authorized researchers. If you are learning security fundamentals,
   please work with qualified instructors and use approved lab environments.

4. LEGAL COMPLIANCE
   - USA: Violations may constitute felonies under the Computer Fraud and
     Abuse Act (18 USC Section 1030)
   - EU: GDPR and national cybercrimes laws apply
   - Most Jurisdictions: Similar laws criminalize unauthorized system access
